    <h2>Manifesto</h2>
    <p class="manifesto-text">
      URAMA is a territory expanding in the half-light.<br>
      A camera lit in the middle of silence.<br><br>
      We film not to remember, but to understand loss.<br>
      The image as breath, as shelter, as a gesture of affection.<br><br>
      Everything that exists vibrates a moment before vanishing.<br>
      There, between shadow and light, we find what is real.<br><br>
      URAMA seeks no answers — it opens questions.<br>
      Each work is a trace, an echo, an attempt to remain.<br><br>
      Cinema as body.<br>
      The gaze as an act of love.
