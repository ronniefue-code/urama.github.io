  <h2>Manifesto</h2>
  <p class="manifesto-text">
    URAMA is a territory expanding in the half-light.<br>
    A camera lit in the middle of silence.<br><br>

    We film not to remember, but to understand loss.<br>
    The image as breath, as shelter, as a gesture of affection.<br><br>

    Everything that exists vibrates a moment before vanishing.<br>
    There, between shadow and light, we find what is real.<br><br>

    URAMA seeks no answers â€” it opens questions.<br>
    Each work is a trace, an echo, an attempt to remain.<br><br>

    Cinema as body.<br>
    The gaze as an act of love.
